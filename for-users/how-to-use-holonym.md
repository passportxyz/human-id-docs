# Identity Verification User Flow

The identity verification process is divided into two steps: **issuance** and **proving**. Once a user has credentials issued, they can prove facts about themself.

## Issuance

A user can obtain their credentials by visiting [https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet) For a smoother experience, it's recommended to use the custom URLs provided in:

{% content-ref url="../for-developers/start-here.md" %}
[start-here.md](../for-developers/start-here.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Proving

Once a user has a Human ID, they can generate proofs of unique personhood, with more proof types planned for the future. To do so, they simply visit [https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet), where they will receive a soulbound token confirming whether their address belongs to a unique person.
