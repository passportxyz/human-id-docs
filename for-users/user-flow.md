# Verifying Identity with Human ID

The Human ID verification process consists of two key stages:

1. **Issuance of Credentials** – Obtaining credentials through identity verification.
2. **Proving Facts About Credentials** – Demonstrating specific details without revealing unnecessary personal information.

## **Issuance**

On the [issuance page](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet), users scan a QR code to begin the verification process by photographing the required identity documents.

## **Proving**

In the proof section, users select a wallet address to link their verified proof. Once the user has a Human ID, they can generate proofs of unique personhood, with more proof types planned for the future. To do so, visit [https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet), where they will receive a soulbound token confirming whether their address belongs to a unique person.

**Convenience vs. Privacy** \
If users trust the KYC provider not to track their wallet, they can immediately prove facts about their credentials. However, for those seeking a cryptographic guarantee that the KYC provider cannot track them, waiting—potentially for days or even weeks—enhances privacy. This follows the same principle as Tornado Cash or ZCash, where longer wait times improve anonymity.
