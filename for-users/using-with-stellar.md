# Using Human ID with Stellar

In order to use Human ID with Stellar, follow the steps below:&#x20;

1. Visit [https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet](https://silksecure.net/holonym/diff-wallet) with an already-funded wallet you would like to use to pay fees on Aurora, Ethereum, Optimism, or Avalanche.
2. Follow the steps to get the proof of unique government ID or phone.
3. When you prove, enter your Stellar address that you want the uniqueness proof to be publicly linked to.

Now you're done! You've obtained the uniqueness proof for the Stellar SBT.

_For higher privacy, you can connect and pay with a wallet address different than the one you want the proof-of-uniqueness to be linked to. You may also delay between paying and proving to prevent timing information from linking your ID to your wallet address. If you do so, even in case of a malicious KYC provider your address with the uniqueness proof can't be linked to your identity._
