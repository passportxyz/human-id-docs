# Issuer

Anybody can make an issuer, as this protocol is decentralized at the base layer. Of course, issuers of credentials should be trusted, despite the fact that anybody can create an issuer. Furthermore, Holonym Foundation operates the frontend and can integrate the issuer into the frontend, so we recommend reaching out in the discord to talk to us and the community before making a custom issuer.
